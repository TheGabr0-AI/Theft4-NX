# Building the base

As checked in, the base builds Beautiful Katamari, so the file names and counts below are Katamari's; a new port's
differ where they name the game (its own manifest, shader finder, tomls). You need your own copy of the game: the code generator and the shader tools read it. Nothing made from it is committed
(`.gitignore`): `app/assets`, `app/generated`, `out/`, `app/out/`.

## Tools

Windows; LLVM clang and the Visual Studio Build Tools (CMake and Ninja) for the PC build (`tools/pc_env.bat` names the
paths); devkitA64, libnx and deko3d from [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org) for the Switch; Python 3 with `xxhash` and
`Pillow`. The deko3d host tools (`out/deko3d_tools`: SPIRV-Cross and the PC uam) come from `tools/deko3d_build_tools.sh`.

## 1. The game

Extract the disc (`tools/extract_iso.py`) and make `app/assets` point at the folder that holds `default.xex`.

## 2. The PC build: code generation and the shader translator

```bat
tools\build_host.bat
tools\build_pc.bat
```

The PC build runs the code generator (`app/renut_manifest.toml`), the post-codegen passes (`tools/post_codegen.py`) and
Renut's XenosRecomp over `out/renut_shader_dump`. Run it with `tools/run_pc.ps1`.

**Code generation again.** The PC build regenerates by itself when the generator (`sdk/out/win-amd64/rexglue.exe`)
relinks. A change to a post-codegen tool, to a header the generated code includes, or a port that says "take it with a
code generation" needs it by hand: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/codegen.ps1`, then
`python tools/post_codegen.py` in full (never one of its steps alone on a finished tree: tools/localize_native.py
refuses copies there), then the builds. Its log names what each step did; `reg_liveness` and `localize_native` print
what the machine copies leave out.

**A new game's calling convention.** Port 121's register liveness (tools/reg_liveness.py) relies on the 360 convention
(v1 is the first vector argument and result; v0 and v32-v63 are scratch; a function reached through a pointer returns
to a caller that reads only results). Check it on each game before trusting it: `python tools/cc_entry_census.py` must
end with "none", and every read `python tools/cc_exit_census.py` lists must be value-independent. If a game breaks it,
generate with `SASRT_REG_LIVENESS_EXIT_ABI=0` (and `SASRT_REG_LIVENESS_HOOKS_ABI=0` for a vector hit).

## 3. The shaders

```bash
python tools/renut_shader_dump.py --image out/renut_image.bin --out out/renut_shader_dump
python tools/katamari_files.py --image out/renut_image.bin --game <game folder> --shaders out/katamari_file_shaders --known out/renut_shader_dump
```

The first takes the 111 containers stored in `default.xex`, the second finds the 84 in the models of `d02.dat`-`d05.dat`
(copy them into `out/renut_shader_dump`). Then:

```bat
powershell -File tools\switch_shaders.ps1
python tools\renut_release_shaders.py
```

`switch_shaders.ps1` translates all 195 to GLSL and makes the everyday build's files (`app/out/renut_switch`, every
shader built into the NRO). A port whose notes say "take it with a shader package made again" needs this step (and the
Switch build after it). A new package changes the shaders' text, so the device compiles their variants once: before a
console measurement, make the DKSH cache from a pipeline list (`python tools/deko3d_variant_cache.py`, its help) so a
first run does not compile while it draws. `renut_release_shaders.py` makes the release build's (`app/out/renut_switch_release`: the
shader table without SPIR-V, and `sd/deko3d_glsl.bin` to put next to the NRO for tests). `BANJO_CENTROID=0` (or
`switch_shaders.ps1 -NoCentroid`) translates without centroid sampling.

## 4. The Switch build

The everyday build (`app/out/switch`, every shader built in, no LTO):

```bat
tools\build_switch.bat
```

The everyday and released NROs carry only the running form of each machine copy (port 78, sasrt-nx's idea 27: CMake
`SASRT_HOT_GUARD_FORMS`, OFF by default on the Switch and ON on the PC): every copy is called directly, and
`banjo_cpu_verify` / `banjo_hot_guard_*` check none of them (the log says so). For a guard or verify run on Ryujinx or
the console, the guard build (`app/out/switch-guard`, otherwise the everyday build's options):

```bat
tools\build_switch_guard.bat
```

then `tools/run_ryujinx.ps1 -Build switch-guard -Toml <file>`. `GUARD_FORMS=ON` (or `OFF`) sets the option in any
folder `tools/build_switch.bat` builds; `tools/build_switch_release.bat` holds its folder at OFF unless `GUARD_FORMS=ON`
(sasrt-nx's `-Final` and `-GuardForms`).

Since port 81 (sasrt-nx's machine copies in place: CMake `SASRT_HOT_IN_PLACE`, ON on the Switch wherever the guard forms
are OFF, OFF on the PC and in `app/out/switch-guard`) the everyday and released NROs have no hooks in front of the copies:
the generated function's symbol is its copy, which the compiler and LTO may inline into its callers, and the generated
original is dropped. The copies' keys (`banjo_cpu_native_sub_*`, `banjo_cpu_native_bulk`), the guard and verify keys,
`banjo_hot_count` and the in-run A/B's target 70 do nothing there, and the log names any that is set; a copy marked `off`
in its list stays generated code. The hand-written natives keep their keys. `IN_PLACE=OFF` (or `ON`) sets the option in
any folder `tools/build_switch.bat` builds (`GUARD_FORMS=ON` sets it OFF); the guard build is hooked and compiles the
same copies' code, so a clean guard run checks the in-place NROs' copies too. After this port, run
`python tools/post_codegen.py` once (or a code generation): it writes the copies' headers with the in-place entry
(not tools/localize_native.py alone: run on the finished tree, after the store cards and other late steps, it refuses
copies) (an in-place build of older headers says so at compile time; its copies stay calls).

The released NRO, in folders of their own (`BUILD_DIR` and `CMAKE_EXTRA` of `tools/build_switch.bat`). The two forms of the
copies compile to different code, so each has its own profile (port 81): `pgo/` for the hooked form (CMake
`BANJO_PGO_DIR`), `pgo-inplace/` for the in-place one (`BANJO_PGO_DIR_IN_PLACE`). A folder writes and reads the one of
its form, so with the defaults these steps make and use `pgo-inplace/`; with `IN_PLACE=OFF` on both folders, `pgo/`:

1. **Instrumented:** `-DBANJO_PGO=generate -DBANJO_SWITCH_LTO=ON`. Play it: it writes `pgo/banjo_pgo_<N>.stream` next to
   the NRO every 2 minutes, at HOME and at exit.
2. **Merge** on the PC that built it (the streams name its folders): `python tools/pgo_merge.py <folder with the
   streams> pgo-inplace` fills `pgo-inplace/` (the second argument `pgo`, or none, for a hooked session; it stops if
   the folder already has `.gcda` files: move them aside first).
3. **Optimised:** `-DBANJO_PGO=use -DBANJO_SWITCH_LTO=ON -DBANJO_RENUT_RELEASE_SHADERS=ON` (`tools/build_switch_release.bat`,
   in place; its configure stops while `pgo-inplace/` has no profile, and `IN_PLACE=OFF` builds the hooked form with
   `pgo/`). It carries no game shader and reads `deko3d_glsl.bin` beside itself. `pgo/` in this repository is the
   profile of the releases before port 81 (the hooked form). A function changed since the instrumented build keeps no
   profile.

Two more PGO options were tried and are not used (blur-nx, 2026-11-12, its CPU batch 3; port 111):

- **Value profiles** (`-fprofile-values`): devkitA64's libgcov is not usable with them as it stands. Its indirect-call
  profiler reads `tpidr_el0` (these builds use `-mtp=soft`: the training NRO crashed in 8 s), its top-n writer frees
  lists it keeps across dumps, its top-n profiler callocs from the game threads, and the writer walks lists other
  threads are still growing. With all four worked around (blur-nx's app/src/banjo_pgo.cpp: a TLS profiler of its own, a
  static node pool, the threads held during a dump) the training NRO still corrupted memory at its first dump (about
  2:15 in, on the console and in Ryujinx, 4 runs of 4), while the same tree trained without value profiles ran clean.
- **`-fipa-reorder-for-locality`** (GCC 16): 24.56 fps against 24.77 in Blur with the same toml, the NRO 2.3 MB larger
  (it clones callees); and with it GCC 16.1's LTO dropped a top-level asm (the `.incbin` that defines the SPIR-V
  cache: an undefined reference at the link), so the generated `.incbin` files would have to be built without LTO.

Keep the temporary folder's path free of spaces (GCC's parallel LTO link writes a makefile with it unquoted). Each build
folder keeps its own SDK libraries (`<folder>/rexglue-sdk/out`, renut-ultimate's `REXGLUE_OUTPUT_IN_BUILD`), so the
stages no longer replace each other's, and the SDK runtime and FFmpeg get the folder's LTO and PGO options
(`BANJO_SWITCH_SDK_OPT`), and since port 89 the SDK's OBJECT libraries too (rexaudio, rexcore,
rexfilesystem, rexinput, rexui; `BANJO_SWITCH_SDK_OBJECT_OPT`), but for four files kept out of LTO:
threading_switch.cpp and switch_perf.cpp (they define `--wrap`'s `__wrap_` functions),
exception_handler_switch.cpp and fiber_switch.cpp (top-level asm naming C symbols, which LTO cannot
see). A new SDK file with either needs the same (`_banjo_sdk_no_lto` in app/CMakeLists.txt), or the LTO
link fails. Their counts need an instrumented run of this build: the profile in `pgo/` has none.

The fixed settings are `app/katamari_switch_defaults.toml`, compiled in; the player's are `app/katamari_switch.toml`,
written next to the NRO as `katamari.toml` when it is missing. A key added to `katamari.toml` overrides a fixed one (the
test runs use that: `tools/run_ryujinx.ps1 -Toml <file>`).

## 5. The installer

[renut_nx_ultimate_installer](https://github.com/ChanseyIsTheBest/renut_nx_ultimate_installer) is the web installer
for any port of this base (2026-11-10): a port forks it, writes its `game.json` and fills `release/` with
`tools/make_release.py` from its tree. It makes `deko3d_glsl.bin` (version 2, with the shader table: the NRO is built
with `-DBANJO_RENUT_RELEASE_SHADERS=ON` and carries no game shader) and the DKSH cache from the player's files, with this
base's translator and passes, and packs the archives `game.json` names as `.lz4b` (port 61). Its `wasm/renut_hlsl` and
`wasm/uam` are built from this tree: rebuild them after a change to the translator, its front end or uam, and run its
`tools/sync_from_base.py` after a change to the Python passes. Its README has the steps; Katamari is its example.

The older page, [katamari-nx-installer](https://github.com/ChanseyIsTheBest/katamari-nx-installer) makes the same `deko3d_glsl.bin` in the
browser. For a new release:

```bash
python tools/katamari_shader_files.py --image out/renut_image.bin --game <game folder> --wanted out/renut_shader_dump --out out/katamari_shader_files.json
```

then its `test/release_node.mjs` (its README). `wasm/renut_hlsl` must be rebuilt after a change to the translator
(`app/thirdparty/reblue-XenosRecomp`, `tools/renut_hlsl_frontend.cpp`): its `wasm/src/deko3d/build_wasm_deko3d.sh`.

## 6. Tests

- **PC:** `tools/run_pc.ps1 -Seconds N -Name X [-Extra "--key=value ..."]` runs the PC build with captures;
  `tools/run_pc_verify.ps1 -Seconds 180 -Name X -Script "20:START,24:A"` runs it with the CPU verify and the guard on
  every machine copy (the log's `[verify]` and `[hot]` lines: 0 differences). The PC build is hooked, so it also checks
  each forwarded stack load against the real one (port 121).
- **Ryujinx:** `tools/run_ryujinx.ps1 -Seconds N -Name X -Toml <file> -Build <folder under app/out>`, with a data folder
  of its own. One run at a time, when no other Ryujinx runs and nothing is compiling (a starved run says nothing);
  `-MinCommitGB` sets the free memory it waits for. It copies the toml over the emulator SD's: put it back after.
  Frame rates and load times in the emulator are not measurements.
- **Guard on the Switch side:** `tools/build_switch_guard.bat`, then a Ryujinx run with `banjo_cpu_verify` and the
  `banjo_hot_guard_*` keys. The guard cannot see a wrong "dead register" claim (its skip set comes from the same
  analysis): a run with `banjo_hot_poison_dead = true` and the guard off fills those registers with garbage after each
  copy call, so a wrong claim shows as a crash, NaNs or a wrong picture.
- **Shader passes:** tools/difftest (its README): each changed shader against its old form, with a deliberately broken
  copy as a control.
- **The console** decides performance: the same NRO both ways (an in-run A/B target, or ABBA order) with a control
  from the same session, fps from Renut's wall-clock 10 s lines.
  Over the network, `tools/switch_remote.py` (sys-botbase and sys-ftpd-light; only the port's own folder on the SD
  card, nothing deleted): [porting-a-360-game-prompt.md](porting-a-360-game-prompt.md), appendix A.
- **Picture bugs:** a RenderDoc capture first, of the PC build or of Ryujinx (`tools/run_ryujinx_rdc.ps1`, then the
  `tools/rdc_*.py` scripts through `tools/rdc_run.ps1`; `RENDERDOC_DIR` names the RenderDoc folder): the porting
  guide's appendix B.
