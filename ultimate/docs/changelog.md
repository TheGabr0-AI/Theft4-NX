# Changelog

One entry per port of the ultimate base, by number. Each port's full row (its source port and commit, the evidence,
how it was tested here, its switch) is in [ultimate-fixes.md](ultimate-fixes.md); the switches that are off by
default are in [off-by-default.md](off-by-default.md).

Ports 1-43 are the first round: the universal fixes of the other ports' renderers, sorted by area in the README's
"What's in it" table and listed in ultimate-fixes.md. From port 44 on:

- On the console the base first cost Ridge Racer 6 4.1 ms of GPU a frame against its own build, at the same frame rate
  but with no headroom left. Port 44 gives 3.2 ms of it back (its game passes at its own build's times), and port 45 (the
  depth decompress only for a read) 0.5 ms more. 0.4 ms, in the game-gamma ramp's present, is still open.
- Port 46 (sasrt-nx, from a console crash) puts the SDK's input system under one lock: a game that reads its
  controllers from more than one thread could free the device list twice.
- Ports 47 and 48 (rr6-nx) take the locks out of Renut's object lookups and shorten the guest clock's read. On the
  console they took Ridge Racer 6's drawing thread from its limit (42-48 fps while racing) to 60 fps with time to spare.
- Port 49 brings sasrt-nx's three GPU rounds (45 items, each with its own key and A/B target). In Ridge Racer 6 they
  take 0.4-0.9 ms of GPU a frame (13.6 -> 13.2 racing); in sasrt-nx's game 68 -> 47 ms. The optimiser passes act once a
  game's shader package and DKSH cache are made again.
- Port 50 is sasrt-nx's fourth GPU round: memexport draws drawn with the rasterizer off no longer go through the
  point-sprite geometry shader, and their export windows are read from the constant buffer. sasrt-nx's game went from
  46.6 to 38.8 ms of GPU a frame; games without memexport draws (Ridge Racer 6) are unchanged.
- Port 51 is sasrt-nx's fifth GPU round (its pixel-identical items): a texture fetch's sign, gamma and exponent
  conversions become constants of the draw, so each pixel shader keeps only the conversions its textures use (sasrt-nx:
  -3.9 ms of GPU a frame; Ridge Racer 6, whose fetches are nearly all plain, flat). It also fixes the DKSH cache tool,
  which read the pipeline list 4 bytes off since the first round.
- Port 52 is what was left of sasrt-nx's changes for any game: dynamic resolution that steps down only when the GPU, not
  the CPU, holds the frame (and any range on the Switch), SMAA after a composite with more than one target, the depth
  restore's whole clear, and a 1 s grace before a controller HID reports absent is disconnected for the game.
- Port 53 makes the CPU time a frame the game thread's own work: the frame cap's sleep and the display pacing's wait
  count as waits, so the FPS overlay's CPU figure and port 52's dynamic resolution see the game's real load.
- Port 54 is sasrt-nx's render-thread round: the EDRAM depth restore's source found from each depth target's own few
  candidates instead of two scans of every target a draw, memory-export seeds written into CPU-cached memory, two
  per-draw counters inlined, and A/B lines that give draws a frame and microseconds a draw.
- Port 55 is feedingfrenzy2-nx's SDK fixes: controllers 2 to 4 sign in as guests when a game opens the sign-in screen,
  players 3 and 4 get their own button maps, the leaderboard calls fail safely, the exit no longer crashes, freed memory
  reads as zeros when it is used again, and five opt-in VMX accuracy keys for the code generator.
- Port 56 is mk9-nx's fixes and ds3-nx's polling back-off: faster physical allocations at loads, fallbacks for a rare
  boot hang, audio that keeps going when the output stalls, a fix for huge stray triangles, one-pass shader compiles
  while a draw waits, the first controller to press Start as player 1, and polling threads that sleep instead of
  spinning a core.
- Port 57 is ds3-nx's SDK fixes: the time a console spends asleep or at HOME no longer reaches the game as one huge
  frame, package reads are one at a time, XMA audio no longer replays sound it has played, modules are found by file
  name when a game remaps its paths, and multi-disc games can take the disc swap over.
- Port 58 is SASRT's memory round: a governor that watches the Switch's free memory and gives caches, idle render
  targets, kept thread stacks and GPU memory back before it runs out (SASRT's docked races went from crashing to
  1,080-1,220 MB of CPU-side heap in use, from 1,526), and the fix for a pipeline shortcut that could draw with the
  previous draw's specialised pipeline (SASRT's broken octopus).
- Port 59 turns controller rumble on by default (the game's own vibration, HD rumble on the Switch's controllers;
  `input_rumble = false` turns it off) and brings two small fixes from LostOdysseyRecomp: texture descriptors made once
  per view, and multiple-object waits without heap allocations.
- Port 60 takes port 56's first-press player swap back out (`input_first_press_is_player1`): the players follow the order
  the controllers connected in again. Ridge Racer 6's Multi Battle found no second controller with it.
- Port 61 lets a game file sit on the card packed as `NAME.lz4b` (LZ4 in 256 KB blocks), read as `NAME`. The ultimate
  installer packs the files a port names; Katamari's archives go from 2.1 GB to 0.9 GB.
- Port 62 stops a release NRO with the web installer's shader package beside it from logging a false "no GLSL package"
  error.
- Port 63 keeps port 04 (a slot after SetTexture(NULL)) to fetches of the same data, so a resolve's texture is not remade
  for other data (Viva Pinata: 64 "[flash] ... dropped" lines in a 200 s run, now none).
- Port 64 is sasrt-nx's GPU hang fix: with dynamic resolution, a texture over a depth resolve is made again when its size
  no longer matches, and image copies and resolves never write past an image.
- Port 65 makes a thread blocked on an event sleep on an address on the Switch, so a woken thread no longer holds the
  event's mutex before it runs (SASRT's main thread spent 5.6 % of its time waiting there; now 0 %).
- Port 66 fixes the PC build's intermittent crash at start in the FPS overlay (the app's dialogs drew before Renut's overlay
  had begun its first frame).
- Ports 67-69 are blur-nx's fixes: the replay inheritance no longer reads and writes past its bit array (67), XenosRecomp
  translates vertex shaders with two bindings (68), and a new port's first builds and runs no longer stop at the path
  wizard, a missing generated/hot, switch_shaders.ps1's stderr or a stale PCH (69).
- Port 70 lets machine copies take in functions with guest atomics (sasrt-nx): each atomic stays as it is, and the guard's
  comparing forms stop before it. A game gets more copies when it remakes its bulk list; retrain its PGO profile after.
- Ports 71-74 are sasrt-nx's machine-copy round, every optimisation on: the SDK's small helpers forced inline and
  setFromMask in NEON (71); VMX's estimates and multiply-add in their faster AArch64 forms, not bit-identical but no
  further from the 360 than before (72); NEON idioms of the generated code (73); and ten copy-generator ideas (74).
  The copies' code changes: retrain a game's PGO profile after them.
- Port 75 is sasrt-nx's renderer formats batch: 2_10_10_10 in the console's own 10:10:10:2 layout, EDRAM formats 10
  and 12 no longer RGBA8, 32-bit float textures point-sampled, and a log of the formats a session makes.
- Port 76 is blur-nx's renderer fixes (keys 211-221): EXPAND / FLOAT resolve aliases, partial resolves that keep
  their destination, occlusion queries answered (a game hooks its own GetData), stack-held surface headers, the
  resolve exponent bias, the EDRAM inherit and more; Viva Pinata's fade mask to recheck (key 218).
- Port 77 is the rule for keys that break a game's picture: off in the base by default, on in the toml of the game
  that needs them (Blur's 218 and Halo 3's replay inherits so far). docs/off-by-default.md lists every switch that
  is off by default, why, and what is known of its speed.
- Port 78 builds the machine copies' guard forms only into guard / verify builds (Katamari's Switch NRO 11 MB
  smaller; tools/build_switch_guard.bat for a Switch guard build), and makes tools/switch_hot_bulk.py leave small
  copies out of a remade bulk list.
- Port 79 keeps emptied render-target memory blocks for the next targets (sasrt-nx: a dynamic-resolution step
  no longer makes ~33 blocks in one frame; its worst frames per window 108 -> 59 ms).
- Port 80 lets a submit clean the upload ring's range in progress itself instead of waiting for the cleaner thread
  (sasrt-nx: no more 280-350 ms render-thread waits at its race start).
- Port 81 puts the machine copies in place of their generated functions on the Switch (sasrt-nx: no hooks, the copies
  inlinable, its game thread 4 % faster and the NRO 4 MB smaller); their keys, the guard and A/B 70 need a hooked
  build (tools/build_switch_guard.bat, IN_PLACE=OFF, the PC), and the in-place form has its own PGO profile
  (pgo-inplace/). sasrt-nx's guide to hand and machine optimising is
  [docs/hand-and-machine-optimising-guide.md](hand-and-machine-optimising-guide.md).
- Port 82 adds sasrt-nx's GPU rows 1, 2 and 4, marked untested (exact by construction; a 10 s log line counts
  what each one did; Katamari hits row 1, with the same frames on and off). Port 83 adds
  tools/profile_breakdown.py (a console stack profile per thread, against the build's map).
- Port 84 turns the bulk copies' link-register elision off by default (vivapinata-nx's guard found it
  differing between a copy's two forms).
- Port 85 takes blur-nx's vector-lane reads: an `stvewx` / `stvehx` lane picked by its address is read from
  the register instead of through the stack (the A57 cannot forward that load); a start-up self-check
  and an SDK test check every lane. input_script takes LT and RT.
- Port 86 turns Blur's EDRAM inherit (key 220) off by default: on the console it drew garbage tiles over Viva
  Pinata's title (blur-nx turns it on).
- Port 87 replays a command buffer a game runs once per predicated tile once for every tile
  (vivapinata-nx's tiles once: -3.74 ms of GPU a frame in its garden on the console).
- Port 88 skips or copies a multisampled resolve of a target unchanged since its last resolve
  (vivapinata-nx: two of its four 2D-engine blits a frame gone, -0.14 ms of GPU).
- Port 89 puts the SDK's OBJECT libraries (audio, core, file system, input, UI) in the Switch LTO and
  PGO too, four files kept out (sasrt-nx: process CPU -0.7 %, render thread -1.9 %).
- Port 90 takes blur-nx's CPU batches 1 and 2: vector conversions, shifts, prefetches and zeroing in
  fewer instructions, grouped card checks, NoteSetWords and the XMA sweep faster (blur-nx's console:
  16.6 -> 18.3 fps). Two of them change the code generator: run a code generation
  (`tools/codegen.ps1`) and `python tools/post_codegen.py` after it.
- Port 91 applies the game's gamma ramp at scan-out from a table (two fetches a pixel instead of three;
  vivapinata-nx: -0.60 ms a frame), port 92 simplifies the fetches through sampler index + k
  (tools/deko3d_glsl_opt.py's samplerk: a shader package made again takes it).
- Port 93 takes sasrt-nx's exact items from its batches C and D the base has the code for: the critical
  section's leave as a raw export, replay and capture prefetches, the render scale's factor and
  coordinates without divisions, pooled held exports.
- Port 94 takes vivapinata-nx's shader round: the fetch folding on vertex shaders too, a fetch's texel step at
  1x without its scale chain, the vertex fetch types for every draw (vivapinata-nx: -8.13 ms of GPU a
  frame with port 92). Take it with a shader package made again (tools/switch_shaders.ps1).
- Port 95 (from vivapinata-nx) makes Renut's early alpha test optional per game (`vivapinata_shader_noearly`, off;
  A/B 151 on the console says which shaders gain, tools/noearly_keep.txt keeps the others' test). Take it with a shader package made again (tools/switch_shaders.ps1).
- Port 96 rounds the single-precision fused multiply-adds (fmadds and kin) once, as the Xenon does, instead of
  a double fused multiply-add rounded again to single; chains stay in float registers (blur-nx: CPU 190 -> 184
  ms a frame). On by default (CMake BLUR_FMADDS_SINGLE); it needs the code generated again (tools/codegen.ps1,
  then tools/post_codegen.py).
- Port 97 turns pacman-nx's vblank display sync off by default (`pacman_vblank_display_sync`): it fixed
  pacman-nx's input lag at full speed but cost blur-nx 15-18 % of its frame rate at 18-21 fps with no latency
  gain. A game at the refresh rate that wants it turns it on in its toml (docs/off-by-default.md).
- Port 98 fixes the specialised pipelines in an in-run A/B's off half (A/B 15-17): each draw made a job it
  never matched (vivapinata-nx: 153 thousand jobs in 13 minutes, the off halves at 1.5-10 fps).
- Port 99 (from vivapinata-nx) moves a pixel shader's final alpha test up to right after what it needs, so a
  discarded pixel skips the colour arithmetic (`vivapinata_shader_earlykill`, on; the same pixels). Take it with a shader package made again (tools/switch_shaders.ps1).
- Port 100 (from dishonored-nx) declares `invariant gl_Position` in every vertex shader, so depth-equal passes
  drawn with different vertex shaders cover the same pixels (Unreal Engine 3's bright silhouette edges). Take it with a shader package made again (tools/switch_shaders.ps1).
- Port 101 (from dishonored-nx) converts only the committed part of a vertex stream or fetch copy and zeros the
  rest, where a range past the game's allocation faulted the render thread (Switch).
- Port 102 (from dishonored-nx) lets XenosRecomp translate a vertex shader that exports to an interpolator its
  table does not list (an assert or a crash before). Take it with a shader package made again (tools/switch_shaders.ps1).
- Port 103 (from dishonored-nx) applies the guest core layout from each thread at its own next wait instead of
  re-masking running threads, the cause of the first-Swap hangs that keep `banjo_renut_core_layout` off.
- Port 104 (from dishonored-nx) watches a tiled texture uploaded with an all-zero level until the game streams
  its data in, then uploads it again (Dishonored's black walls and heads at a distance).
- Port 105 (from dishonored-nx, sa2-nx's) feeds Renut's render thread from a lock-free ring instead of a vector
  under a mutex (`dishonored_renut_lockfree_queue`; sa2-nx: the queue's locks 0.83 -> 0.18 ms of the game thread).
- Port 106 (from dishonored-nx) clamps a pixel shader's output into a 7e3 target to the 7e3 range, as the Xenos
  stores it (`dishonored_renut_clamp_7e3`; constant 990, sasrt_words[7] bits 28-31). Take it with a shader package made again (tools/switch_shaders.ps1).
- Port 107 (from blur-nx's CPU batch 3) reads dcbz's block check once, rounds frsp with one range test and
  uses the plain single-precision forms where both operands are proven single. Take it with a code generation.
- Port 108 (from blur-nx) stops leaf_dead_stores counting functions named only in the promotion and draft lists
  as address-taken, so their copies write back only what callers read.
- Port 109 (from blur-nx) adds `switch_thread_priorities` and `switch_thread_cores`: per-thread host priorities
  and core masks by thread name, for A/Bs (empty by default).
- Port 110 (from blur-nx) makes a mutant released before its native object exists fail as not owned instead
  of crashing.
- Port 111 records blur-nx's batch 3 notes: the XMA frame cache size per game, and the two PGO options it
  tried and does not use (docs/building.md).
- Port 112 makes each guest thread's host stack 8 MB by default (16 before; `switch_guest_stack_mb`: a game
  with a deep recursion sets 16 in its toml).
- Port 113 (from vivapinata-nx) makes difftest_game.py read `--cbset`, adds `--texalias` / `--texcopy`, and
  removes each run's temp folder when it ends.
- Port 114 (from vivapinata-nx) adds `renut_gpu_profile_counters`: pixels shaded and Zcull's words beside each
  GPU profile line (deko3d, off).
- Port 115 (from vivapinata-nx) can leave out multisampled depth resolves nothing reads until something does
  (`vivapinata_depth_resolve_skip_unread`, off: not exact in principle).
- Port 116 marks Katamari's `disable_msaa` as not read (`msaa_level` sets the samples).
- Port 117 takes a home-network address out of `log_network`'s help text.
- Port 118 makes MSAA off (`msaa_level` 1) and SMAA on (`banjo_renut_smaa`) the base's defaults; a game lists its
  final composite shader in `banjo_renut_smaa_after_ps` for SMAA to run.
- Port 119 (sasrt-nx's, from vivapinata-nx) lets dynamic resolution step up when the next height has 1 ms of room,
  one step at a time, with a grid of heights per mode.
- Port 120 (from blur-nx) adds `audio_xma_kick_without_lock` (off): an XMA kick no longer waits for a decode in
  progress (Blur's console +5.9 % fps); the XMA frame cache can go up to 512 MB.
- Port 121 (sasrt-nx's batch CC2) gives the machine copies whole-program register liveness with the vector
  registers and forwards stack stores into vector loads (sasrt-nx: -2.5 % CPU). Check a game's convention with
  tools/cc_entry_census.py and cc_exit_census.py, and take it with a code generation.
- Port 122 (sasrt-nx's) makes tools/pgo_merge.py refuse a folder of streams from more than one build.
- Port 123 (from blur-nx) adds CG-13, all guest float code in one flush mode (`BLUR_FPCR_ONE_MODE`, OFF: not
  bit-exact for scalar denormals; Blur's console +4.6 % fps), and its census.
- Port 124 (from blur-nx) counts every promoted call target as address-taken in leaf_dead_stores.
- Port 125 (from blur-nx) turns the user clip slot off for pipelines that write no clip distance (Renut's host
  passes on deko3d; Blur's black band).
- Port 126 adds tools/switch_remote.py (sys-botbase and sys-ftpd-light, the port's own SD folder only, no delete)
  and the porting guide's appendices on the console and RenderDoc.
- Port 127 (from blur-nx) keeps the console's EDRAM tricks working when `msaa_level` lowers a target's samples
  (port 118's default of 1): the sample-grid resolve, the EDRAM inherit, alpha to coverage with the game's own
  alpha test, and the depth restore's candidates go by the console's sample count.
- Port 128 (from blur-nx) lets SMAA run on RGBA16F composite targets (Blur's float composite).
