"""banjo-nx: "localized copies" of recompiled guest functions, the native replacements of app/src/cpu/banjo_hot_guest.cpp.

From sa2-nx's tools/localize_native.py (GPL-3.0, the same project family; sa2-nx took the idea from
UnleashedRecomp-NX's switch-localize.py), rewritten for Banjo's generated code and for a guard that needs no
hand-written list of the memory a function writes.

A copy runs the recompiled function's own statements (app/generated/renut_recomp.N.cpp, after every post-codegen step)
with these differences:
  - the guest registers the function keeps in the PPCContext (the volatile ones: r0, r3-r12, f0-f13, v0-v13, and
    whatever else it mentions as ctx.<register>) live in C++ locals: loaded at entry, written back at every return
    (only those the function can have changed) and synchronised around calls (below);
  - direct callees that are small enough come along as copies of their own, in the same header ("the closure"), so the
    compiler can inline them and a call costs no hook and no full register hand-over;
  - a call synchronises only what the callee can reach: before it, the registers this function may have changed that
    the callee (or anything it calls) mentions; after it, the registers the callee (or anything it calls) can have
    changed. A callee whose reach is unknown (an indirect call, a trap, a kernel import, a function an app hook
    replaces, a mid-asm hook) gets every register.

Each function is written three times into app/generated/hot/n_<id>.h:
  f_<name><Fast>     the copy that runs;
  f_<name><Logged>   the same text, every guest store first recorded in a write log (address, length, old bytes);
  o_<name>           the ORIGINAL statements (registers in ctx), stores recorded the same way.
The two logged forms are how the guard learns which guest memory a call writes without a list per function: it runs
both on copies of the registers, rolls the memory back from the log, and then runs the real copy and the real
recompiled function over a snapshot of exactly those bytes (banjo_hot_guest.cpp). A logged form stops at the first
call it cannot repeat (anything outside the closure): that call of the function is then not comparable.
sasrt-nx (2026-11-11, port 81; machine copies in place): the entry, n_<id>::Native, is
written "BANJO_HOT_NATIVE_SPEC inline void Native" (app/src/cpu/banjo_hot_guest.h: [[gnu::noinline]] behind a hook,
nothing with CMake SASRT_HOT_IN_PLACE, where the hook is a bare redirect and the copy may be inlined into its callers).

What cannot be a copy (the tool says why and writes nothing): a function, or a closure member, with setjmp / longjmp,
an atomic compare-and-swap or a memory barrier (state shared with other threads: the guard's roll-back would be seen),
MMIO, the guest time base, a mid-asm hook, or a guest-memory write in a form the tool does not know.

HAND-WRITTEN NATIVES (app/src/cpu/hot/hand.txt, the code in app/src/cpu/hot/banjo_hand_natives.h). A function of
that list has a native version written by hand, banjo::hand::n_<id>::Native(ctx, base, s), which returns false when it
declines a call. Wherever this tool uses the generated copy f_<name> of such a function (as the function of a hook, or
as a callee inside another function's copy) the hand-written native is asked first and the generated copy runs only
when it declines. The original's logged form o_<name> is untouched: the guard still compares against the original's
statements. A hand-written native writes no register; the registers the original changes (this tool reads them from
its statements; hand.txt's exact= names those the native leaves as the original does) are that hook's "skip" set,
written as kSkip into every header whose copy contains the native: the guard does not compare them.

  python tools/localize_native.py --list app/src/cpu/hot/localized.txt      every function of the list (post_codegen.py)
  python tools/localize_native.py --list --bulk                             and the bulk list (post_codegen.py)

BULK (2026-10-22, bejeweled3-nx's method, docs/enhancements.md "Bulk localized copies"): app/src/cpu/hot/
localized_bulk.txt (written by tools/switch_hot_bulk.py from console profiles) lists hundreds more functions. Each is
made the same way; one the tool refuses is left out and named in the output. Their hooks are BANJO_HOT_HOOK_BULK lines
spread over app/generated/hot/banjo_hot_bulk_<k>.inc by the size of their headers, each compiled by its own
app/src/cpu/banjo_hot_shard_<k>.cpp, so the copies compile in parallel. One master key, banjo_cpu_native_bulk,
switches them all (each also has its own key).

# the guard compares against the original stores). Both write exactly the bytes the original writes and mark the same
# store cards. Switch back: SASRT_HOT_MERGED_STORES=OFF (CMake), which compiles the original statements
# (SASRT_HOT_MERGED_STORES_OFF).
#   - stvlx at ea, stvrx at ea + 16: the 16 bytes of one vector at [ea, ea + 16) (the generated helpers store them in
#     8/4/2/1-byte pieces chosen by the address): one 16-byte store when the second address is the first + 16 at run
#     time and the range does not cross the PC's physical-view boundary;
#   - four stvewx of one vector at ea, ea + a, ea + b, ea + c (each the lane its address selects; the generated code
#     spills the vector and loads each lane back by a computed index): one 16-byte store of the four words when a, b,
#     c are 4, 8, 12 at run time (::banjo::hand::detail::StoreWordsOfVector).
# The address expressions are register arithmetic only (no loads), so evaluating the second one before the first store
# reads what the original reads. The patterns take the plain forms (and the store-card forms, _C): post_codegen.py takes
# the cards out (store_cards.py --restore) before the copies are made and puts them back after (sasrt-nx's round A
# audit: matching only the _C forms, the merge never fired). The merged store marks its own cards (REX_CARD, a no-op
# without store cards), and store_cards.py gives the original statements of the fallback branch theirs.
