// banjo-nx (2026-10-22): what each shard of the bulk copies (banjo_hot_shard_<k>.cpp) includes before its copies,
// as banjo_hot_guest.cpp does for the hand-picked list: the generated code's macros (a copy is generated statements),
// the hook machinery (banjo_hot_guest.h) and the hand-written natives a copy asks first (hot/hand.txt).
// The method is bejeweled3-nx's (bulk localization, its docs/optimising-functions.md).

// sasrt-nx (2026-11-11, port 74; its idea 39): store-card runs in the bulk copies (tools/localize_native.py,
// CARD_RUNS). A copy's function keeps the page of its run of stores (rex_card_run; 0xFFFFF: none pending) and marks a
// page's card when the run moves to another page; REX_CARD_FLUSH marks the pending one (before calls, fences and
// returns, and at the end) and clears it. A compare-and-swap marks the pending page and its own at once. With nothing
// pending a flush compiles to nothing (sasrt-nx's batch 2 audit, finding 1: a function that stores nothing marks
// nothing). Only for copies written with the runs (hot/banjo_hot_options.h: finding 2). The hand-written natives above
// keep marking at each store (their REX_CARD was expanded before this point).

// run's page is marked as before (when the run moves on, and at a flush: after its stores), but
// - only a page whose card Renut reads: the views it checks (draw.cpp's PhysicalOf: 0xA0000000 and up, and
//   0x7F000000-0x7FFFFFFF) and the page in front of each (Renut counts a page as written when the page before it is:
//   an unaligned store into a view's first page marks the page in front), so 0x9FFFF-0xFFFFF and 0x7EFFF-0x7FFFF;
//   the cards of other pages are never read (Blur's audio and object data, the heap's virtual views);
// - the card byte only written when it is not zero yet: a zero card is the result either way, and the card lines
//   (64 cards each) stay shared between the cores instead of moving at every page change of every thread;
// - "no run" is 0x100000, outside the 20-bit pages: port 74's 0xFFFFF was also the top page of the 0xE0000000 view,
//   whose run was then never marked.
