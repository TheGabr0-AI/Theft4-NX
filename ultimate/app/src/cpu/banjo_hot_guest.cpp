// banjo-nx - native replacements of hot guest functions (CPU enhancements banjo_cpu_native_*).
//
// The mechanism is sa2-nx's (app/src/cpu/sa2_hot_guest.cpp, GPL-3.0; it came there from masseffect-nx's
// me_hot_guest.cpp): each hook replaces one recompiled function by a native version and checks itself. Banjo's
// natives are all "localized copies" written by tools/localize_native.py (app/generated/hot/n_<id>.h, listed in
// app/src/cpu/hot/localized.txt): the recompiled function's own statements with its context registers in C++ locals.
//
// THE GUARD. For the first banjo_hot_guard_calls calls of each thread, one call in banjo_hot_guard_period afterwards
// and EVERY call with banjo_cpu_verify, a call is answered like this:
//   1. the copy's logged form runs on a copy of the registers: every guest store is recorded with the bytes it
//      replaces; the memory is rolled back from that log;
//   2. the ORIGINAL statements' logged form runs the same way and is rolled back;
//      (if either reached a call it cannot repeat - anything outside the copy: an indirect call, a kernel import, a
//      hooked function - the call is "not comparable": the recompiled original answers it in verify mode, the copy
//      otherwise, and it is counted;)
//   3. the bytes either of them wrote are the compare set: they are saved, the real copy runs on a copy of the
//      registers, its bytes are taken and the saved ones put back;
//   4. the recompiled original runs for real;
//   5. every register of the context, the written bytes and the host's flush mode are compared, and so are the
//      registers of the two logged runs.
// A difference that repeats when the whole pass is made again from the same inputs (three passes in a row) logs
// "[hot] DIFFERENCE ...", counts as a difference of the verify session (me::native::VerifyDifference) and switches
// that hook off for the rest of the run: the original had already produced the state. One that does not repeat came
// from another thread changing the inputs between the runs; it is counted apart ("did not repeat").
// A hook also stays off unless the loaded guest code is byte for byte the code its copy was made from.
//
// WHY EXACT: the copies are the same statements (tools/localize_native.py says what is renamed); the guard runs both.
// RISK: a difference on inputs the guard did not see; state another thread changes between the guard's runs is
//   reported as a difference (a false one) and only costs that hook.
// KEYS: banjo_cpu_native_<function> each (CPU group, under banjo_cpu_enhancements); banjo_hot_guard_calls,
//   banjo_hot_guard_period; banjo_hot_count (a measurement, see Counted).
// BUILD: sasrt-nx (2026-11-10, port 78; its idea 27): the guard runs the copies' two logged forms, which only a build
//   with CMake SASRT_HOT_GUARD_FORMS has (ON by default on the PC; OFF on the Switch, where tools/build_switch_guard.bat
//   makes an NRO with them). Without them every hook calls its copy directly and InitHook says so once.
//   sasrt-nx (2026-11-11, port 81; machine copies in place): with CMake SASRT_HOT_IN_PLACE (ON by
//   default on the Switch wherever the guard forms are OFF) there are no hooks at all: the generated function's
//   symbol is the copy (banjo_hot_guest.h), nothing of the guard runs and no copy's key is read; InPlaceNotes says so
//   once at start-up and names each key set against the build. The hand-written natives keep their own keys.
//
// Name no guest function's address in this file: tools/direct_calls.py and tools/localize_native.py treat every
// 82xxxxxx address the app's sources mention as hooked. The list is app/src/cpu/hot/localized.txt.
