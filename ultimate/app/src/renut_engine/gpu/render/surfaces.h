/**

 * @brief   Host render targets behind guest D3DSurfaces.
 *
 * N&B's own D3DDevice_CreateSurface still builds the surface (and does its
 * EDRAM bookkeeping); the renderer attaches a host color or depth target to
 * the EDRAM view the surface describes (base, pitch, samples, format) the
 * first time a surface over it is bound, sized and formatted from the surface
 * header. Surfaces over the same view share the target, as they share EDRAM
 * on the GPU; content lives in it while any of them does, which is what the
 * game relies on between Clear, draws and Resolve.
 * All functions require State().mutex.
