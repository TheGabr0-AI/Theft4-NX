// banjo-nx (2026-10-19, latency batch 3): the frame limiter locked to the display's refresh, and the input -> display
// measurement (renut_engine/display_sync.cpp).
//
// On the Switch the compositor shows a new image only at its 60 Hz refresh (there is no tearing mode; swap interval 0
// only stops the present from waiting). The frame limiter (frame_cap) released the game's frames on its own 33.3 ms
// timer, at a phase to the refresh that slid as the two clocks drifted: an image finished just after a refresh waited
// almost 16.7 ms more, and now and then one was shown for three refreshes and the next for one. Here a thread follows
// the display's vsync event (viGetDisplayVsyncEvent): the limiter releases each frame at a refresh plus a phase, and
// the phase is found by measurement (banjo_display_phase_auto): as late as the frame's image still makes the refresh it
// made before. A frame that ends late is released at once as before (no snapping to 20 fps).

// gives back only at the refresh the frame was meant for: one late image (a load, a slow frame) and every image after it
// is shown a refresh late (about 17 ms more input lag, still 60 fps), for as long as the game keeps up. The display
// thread counts the new images not finished at their refresh; after a second of them it asks for the game's next frame
// to be released one refresh later, once: the image before it makes its refresh, the queue empties. TakeHold: whatever
// paces the game takes that request (the display thread's frame start below, or a numeric frame_cap's limiter). This
// empties the queue only if the game then stays on the display's grid: with nothing pacing it the game catches up at

// display with 14 ms of work. At each refresh the display thread tests the newest image's fence and sets the phase, then
// after the phase gives a tick; the game's Swap (renutFrameLimit, pacman_keys.cpp) waits for it. Futari's vblank handler
// is not used: this game's frames do not count vblanks, so the wait is at the Swap. FramePacingOn: the key and
